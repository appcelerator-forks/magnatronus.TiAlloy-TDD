Titanium Alloy Jasmin Unit Test Widget

## TiTDD version 1.0

A TDD Alloy Widget for Appcelerator Titanium thats is based on Jasmine 1.3.1 created originally by
Steve Rogers. Based on the TiJamine module code by Bill Dawson.

## Info
- This is a complete Alloy Test Application. The only thing you need to do is to add your test specs
  to the project and then indicate in the widget which specs you want to execute.
  
- The spec files must be added/created in the project app/lib dir under the spec directory. The example specs
  that come with Jasmine 1.3.1 are already in the project and set up ready to run.
  
- To specify which specs to use just add them to the widget xml in the spec attribute. This is just a comma seperated list of specs

		<Widget id='tester' src="jut" spec="PlayerSpec,SpecHelper"/>  
		
 Just see the main project index.xml for an example.
 
 
## Caveat

- This is a test project that I created after looking at Bill Dawson's TiJasmine module and using it to understand more about Jasmine and how it could be used in a TiAlloy app.
  The result is this project that I hope may be of use to others.
